This is the set of scripts that I originally wrote to create the
historic linux kernel tree at https://archive.org/details/git-history-of-linux

The various tarballs/patches live in dirs relevant to their versions
in the 'binaries' topdir. You will need to download them all from
kernel.org, and put them in a directory structure that looks like..

 0.x/
 1.0/
 1.1/
 1.2/
 1.3/
 1.99/
 2.0/
 2.1/
 2.2/
 2.3/
 2.4/

Changelogs where available, are pulled from the changelogs/ dir.

To generate the git tree, run these commands in order..

untar.sh
make-diffs.sh
import.sh

These will call the ancillary scripts for each branch.

You will need approximately 28G of disk space for the whole process.
