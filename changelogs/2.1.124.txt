Linux-2.1.124...

.. is out there now, and includes:

 - subtle fix for lazy FP save and restore on x86. The bug has been there
   for a long time, but was apparently triggered by the re-write of the
   low-level scheduling function. It could result in corrupted i387 state
   under certain (admittedly fairly unlikely) circumstances.
 - various networking updates. Some of the bugs fixed could result in
   kernel Oopses. None of them were common, though.
 - fixes for both filesystem accounting and quota handling.
 - the much-ado-about-little video driver merge.
 - PPC and Sparc updates
 - i386/SMP interrupt handling falls back on the safe mode.. Please tell
   me whether there are still machines with problems.
 - some new network drivers and updates
 - final (we hope) IP masquerade update

I still have a problem with certain machines that apparently don't want to
boot with the keyboard not plugged in even though they should. Kill me
now. If you have problems with i386/SMP on a machine without a keyboard,
plug one in and send me a report..
