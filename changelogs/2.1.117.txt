Linux 2.1.117

I made a 117 to fix the silly things left in 116 in my excitement over it
passing all my crashtests. This should fix the things with the kernel
thinking it was out of memory much sooner than it actually was etc.

Alan still reports some funnies with unix domain sockets, but he's
reportedly fixed the behaviour of NFS over TCP. He didn't make it sound as
if you really want to use it yet, though ;)
