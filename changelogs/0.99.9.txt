[PATCH] Linux-0.99.9 (April 23, 1993)

Bill's math emulator now passes paranoia.

Last argument to ioctl is "long".

sys_clone() appears.

[original announcement below]

The latest kernel release is 0.99.9, and can be found on nic.funet.fi:
pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus, both as patches relative to pl8 and as full
sources.  The only major new feature is that the ST-0x driver has
finally been updated to the scatter-gather code: ST-0x users should with
luck get about 5 times the performance on disk-operations..  Seagate
code written by Drew Eckhardt.
    
0.99.9 also fixes:
- the FPU-emulator should now handle all rounding-modes correctly, and
  pass all the paranoia package tests.  Patches by Bill Metzenthen.
- bootup enhancements by Chrisoph Niemann (but the SVGA mode numbers
  have changed, so you may have to edit your lilo configuration file
  and/or the main Makefile to get the mode you normally want)
- ext2fs updated to the very latest release.  Code by Remy Card and
  Stephen Tweedie.
- various minor patches, some of them cosmetic, some of them fixes to
  smaller bugs..  Thanks to everybody who sent them in (even though not
  all made it)
    
It might be a good idea to test it all out,
    
            Linus
