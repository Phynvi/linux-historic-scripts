There's a pre-3 patch on ftp.kernel.org in the kernel/testing directory,
and I'd really like people to give it a good testing: especially if you've
seen slow network connections to some clients (ie Windows). David worked
in the compatibility patches to work around some of the Windows TCP stack
"features" (and Apple too, for that matter), and we want to get this well
tested. It's all fairly straightforward, but let's be careful out there..
