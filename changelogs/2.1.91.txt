Linux 2.1.91

I just made a real 91 on ftp.kernel.org, let's hope that this has all the
sillies gone. As usual, it is prefectly smooth on my machine, but this
time we also have a better chance of it being smooth on machines with less
memory too, as Rik has done some good work in testing the algorithms out.
So throw some problems at it to see just how good it is..
