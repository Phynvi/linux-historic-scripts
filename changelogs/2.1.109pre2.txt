pre-2.1.109-2..

To get people away from their normally scheduled copyright discussions, I
made a pre-2.1.109 to try out. I woul dhave made a real 2.1.109, but my
computer room has been taken over by visiting relatives, and they want to
go to sleep. Ye Gods!

Get it from ftp.kernel.org, /pub/linux/kernel/testing as usual. It has
 - CPU detection in C code (and thus much easier to expand upon,
   especially as it's all thrown away after booting now that it is
   "initfunc()").  This should finally get the Cyrix case right, for
   example. Please test.
 - too meny people convinced me that sendfile() really wants to act like
   writep().
 - sound driver updates from Alan.
 - console updates, so now we have the full old functionality again as far
   as I'm concerned (but I'm sure people will tell me something is still
   missing)
 - task switch and user space return cleanly handles bad segment
   descriptors etc, so people shoul dno longer be able to cause kernel
   messages by misusing the LDT.
 - wine should work again thanks to Bill Hawes (other LDT fixes)
 - de4x5 driver update
 - token ring driver update
 - ppp driver update
 - coda-fs update
 - "shared writable" bug fixed (thanks to a lot of people for testing and
   working on this - the actual fix was trivial once the problem was
   understood)
Check it out,

                Linus
