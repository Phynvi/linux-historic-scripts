[PATCH] Linux-0.98.1 (October 5, 1992)

Add ATI XL busmouse driver by Bob Harris, split off MS busmouse driver into
a driver of its own (rather than a subdriver of the Logitech mouse driver)

FAT uid/gid/umask mount options.

SCSI driver updates.

[Original announcement below]

Patch1 to 0.98 mainly corrects some driver problems: it contains the
added "inb_p(HD_STATUS)" for hd.c, as well as a changed mouse driver
setup (hope it works - I couldn't test it..).  There are also some SCSI
driver patches: the seagate driver uses irqaction() to get irq's, and
the aha1542 driver has the speedup patches.

The bootimage should be compiled without the auto-SVGA mode, so people
who had problems with linux automatically using a SVGA mode should be ok
in this release.
