Second patch to 0.96a

I have just sent off the second patch to 0.96a: it should be on the
normal ftp-sites (nic, tsx-11 and banjo), although the only site which I
can make it directly readable on is banjo, so on the other sites it will
take the site-managers to make the patch available.

Patch 2 implements:

- itimers (by Darren Senn), which are now also used to implement the
  alarm() system call.

- ultrastor scsi driver patches (by gentzel)

- [f]statfs() system call is implemented (so df can be made fs-
  independent). Also some other minor fs-changes for the upcoming new
  filesystem. Patches by Remy Card.

- preliminary core-file dumping code (linux creates a core-file, but
  it's not in the correct format yet [*]).

- minor changes/bugfixes.

While patching in patch1 is a good idea for anybody, patch 2 isn't
really vital. I've made it available just so kernel hackers can keep up
with the kernel I have right now if they wish. Patch 2 is relative to
patch 1: you have to patch that in first.

[*] The current core-file is very simple, and the kernel code is there
just so that some enterprising character can expand it. A core-file
looks like this right now:

offset data
0x0000 "core-dump: regs=\n"
0x0040 struct pt_regs (see <sys/ptrace.c>)
0x0400 "floating-point regs:\n"
0x0440 struct i387 (see <linux/sched.h>)
0x0800 the first 1kB of user-space

Not very practical, but it /might/ help if the X-server dies of a
segmentation fault or similar (you can use pt_regs.eip to see where it
happened). The kernel code is very easy to change to accomodate for the
real core-file format, I just didn't know what it should be.
