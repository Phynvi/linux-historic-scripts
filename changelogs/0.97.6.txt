[PATCH] Linux-0.97.6 (September 20, 1992)

Ted Ts'o did extensive serial driver changes, and fixed up some of the
tty layer to match.  Tty's now allocated dynamically.

[Original announcement below]

This patch does not contain any major bug-fixes: it corrects named pipes
that broke with pl5, and has some minor changes in the IO-instructions
and the hd-driver, but those shouldn't matter for most of you.

It does contain all the scsi-patches that I've gotten so far, so if the
bootup sequence died on you in the scsi code, pl6 should correct this.

The major part of the patch is tytso's serial line changes, making the
tty structures dynamic.  No more NR_PTY's - the number of pty's is now
bounded only by the minor number setup (max 64 pty's) or the amount of
memory available (opening a pty requires a page of memory for tty
queues).  Similarly for serial lines.

The above just means that while pl6 can be useful, the changes to pl5
aren't big enough to worry about.  Most people don't use named pipes, it
seems, and the other changes are either cosmetic or hardware-dependent.
I still hope people upgrade, if only so that I can get new bug-reports.

I had hoped to release 0.98 this weekend, but studies and the scsi/hd
problems put an end to that.  0.98 should be out next weekend or so.
Expect the tcp/ip subdirectory and possibly some mm changes.
