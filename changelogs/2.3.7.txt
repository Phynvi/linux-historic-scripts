Linux-2.3.7.. Let's be careful out there..

The new and much improved fully page-cache based filesystem code is now
apparently stable, and works wonderfully well performancewise. We fixed
all known issues with the IO subsystem: it scales well in SMP, and it
avoids unnecessary copies and unnecessary temporary buffers for write-out.

The shared mapping code in particular is much cleaner and also a _lot_
faster.

In short, it's perfect. And we want as many people as possible out there
testing out the new cool code, and bask in the success stories..
HOWEVER. _Just_ in case something goes wrong [ extremely unlikely of
course. Sure. Sue me ], we want to indeminfy ourselves. There just might
be a bug hiding there somewhere, and it might eat your filesystem while
laughing in glee over you being naive and testing new code. So you have
been warned.

In particular, there's some indication that it might have problems on
sparc still (and/or other architectures), possibly due to the ext2fs byte
order cleanups that have also been done in order to reach the
afore-mentioned state of perfection.
I'd be especially interested in people running databases on top of Linux:
Solid server in particular is very fsync-happy, and that's one of the
operations that have been speeded up by orders of magnitude.
