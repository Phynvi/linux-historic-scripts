pre-2.1.132-4..

There's a new pre-patch on ftp.kernel.org. I've been waiting for a few
other things, but the pre-patches are getting to be so big that it's
getting unwieldly, so I'll probably make a real 2.1.132 real soon now. In
the meantime, there's a pre-patch that people can verify for sanity (this
one should have coda-fs back to working order, for example - patch
craziness corrupted a simple update in pre-3).
