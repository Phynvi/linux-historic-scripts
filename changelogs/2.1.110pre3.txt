What 2.1.110-3 does is to much more aggressively throw out dentries (and
thus inodes) under low-memory circumstances.  It may be _too_ aggressive
right now, but if so that just gives a good mid point to strive for.

I'd really like to hear comments about how this "feels" (and numbers
too, if you have them).  It's fairly hard for me to judge, as whenever I
run Linux on small-memory machines it always feels slower than I'm used
to, regardless of whether Linux does the right thing or not ;)
