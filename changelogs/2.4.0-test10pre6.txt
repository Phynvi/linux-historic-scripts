Linux 2.4.0-test10-pre6

pre6 has tons of small fixes, the most noticeable of which are

 (a) the new compiler requirements (sorry, but it turned out that 2.7.2.3
     really is too subtly broken with named structure initializers that
     are very heavily used these days inside the kernel)

     Suggested stable compiler: gcc-2.91.66, aka egcs-1.1.2, which is the
     one most vendors have been shipping for a long time, and while sure
     to be buggy too has not been found to be seriously so at least yet.

     Other modern gcc versions may well work too.

 (b) various PCI fixes that used to make 2.4.0 completely unboot/usable on
     certain machines (ALI chipsets with certain PIRQ routing tables and
     laptops with some docking bridges. Oh, and PIIX4 chipsets with USB
     enabled and certain other magic things going on).

     Let's hope that there aren't too many more of these. The ALI one in
     particular was "interesting" to chase down. More interesting than I
     personally need in my old age.

The rest of the changes should be mostly unnoticeable.

Still known: the same old "page->mapping = NULL" thing that has not seen
an acceptable fix yet. If it wasn't for that, I'd have called this test10
already and be done with it. Super-Al to the rescue (and no, that was not
a reference to the current sad state of US politics).

 - pre6:
    - Jeremy Fitzhardinge: autofs4 expiry fix
    - David Miller: sparc driver updates, networking updates
    - Mathieu Chouquet-Stringer: buffer overflow in sg_proc_dressz_write
    - Ingo Molnar: wakeup race fix (admittedly the window was basically
      non-existent, but still..)
    - Rasmus Andersen: notice that "this_slice" is no longer used for
      scheduling - delete the code that calculates it.
    - ALI pirq routing update. It's even uglier than we initially thought..
    - Dimitrios Michailidis: fix ipip locking bugs
    - Various: face it - gcc-2.7.2.3 miscompiles structure initializers.
    - Paul Cassella: locking comments on dev_base
    - Trond Myklebust: NFS locking atomicity. refresh inode properly.
    - Andre Hedrick: Serverworks Chipset driver, IDE-tape fix
    - Paul Gortmaker: kill unused code from 8390 support.
    - Andrea Arcangeli: fix nfsv3d wrong truncates over 4G
    - Maciej W. Rozycki: PIIX4 needs the same USB quirk handling as PIIX3.
    - Linus: if we cannot figure out the PCI bridge windows, just "inherit"
      the window from the parent. Better than not booting.
    - Ching-Ling Lee: ALI 5451 Audio core support update
