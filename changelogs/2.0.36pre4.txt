Linux 2.0.36pre4

This one updates the tulip and 3c509 drivers, so give those a beating. The
mdelay/udelay problem with the aic7xxx update is fixed. A small root
permissions bug in /proc is fixed and a few other minor things.

Modular sound isnt in this one. Its about 60/40 in favour but I decided
the 40% were right. It changes expected behaviour for people which isnt
good for 2.0

The main thing left to sort now is the final CPU detection. Im still getting
some reports of misdetections
