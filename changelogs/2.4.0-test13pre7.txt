The LDT fixes in particular fix some potentially random strange behaviour.
And the alpha memmove() thing was a showstopper bug on alphas.

		Linus

- x86 LDT handling fixes: revert some cleanups (the LDT really
  doesn't act like a TLB context)
- Richard Henderson: alpha update (working memmove() from Ivan
  Kokshaysky etc)
- Manfred: winbond-840.c net driver update (fix oops on module unload etc)
- Alan Cox: more synchronizations (with some fixes from Andrew Morton)
