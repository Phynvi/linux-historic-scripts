2.0.36pre18

Fixes from pre17
o       5.1.4 aic7xxx driver (EISA 274x cards now work)
o       SMP debug message removed
o       TCP performance optimisation from Dave Miller (and I thought he
                was on honeymoon 8))
o       Makefile fix for modules/versioning bug
o       A couple of very minor cleanups

If this proves ok it goes to Linus
