Linux 2.1.87

Ok, 2.1.87 is out there on ftp.kernel.org now, and it has the clever
PROT_NONE thing done. It seems to work for the little test-case I wrote,
and I also verified that swapping still works, so it seems to be all ok.
I'd still like people who have test programs or similar to actually check
it out,
