[PATCH] Linux-0.95c+ (April 9, 1992 ??)

Bruce Evans shows up here quickly. 

Bruce was the author of the Minix/386 patches, and had been one of my
sounding boards for my early development, so it was very gratifying to
see him get interested in Linux.  As it turned out, what he was _really_
interested in was the serial driver, and the Linux serial driver was
already in reasonably good shape. 

As a result, Bruce went off to work on 386BSD instead (where the serial
driver was truly crappy), but here he worked on some boot loader cleanups.

Bruce was my hero.

Anyway...  More VFS work here: readdir, bmap and ioctl's are now virtual
operations, and the superblock code is properly virtualized. 

Other changes:

 - James Wiegand writes initial parallell port printer driver

 - major/minor fault tracking

 - I rewrote big chunks of ptrace.c
