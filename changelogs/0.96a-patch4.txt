32-bit inodes: patch4
    
Ok, patch4 implements 32-bit inode numbers (and thus the new
stat/lstat/fstat system calls), as well as correcting the bad
rs-performance on some machines that showed up in patch3. It's
currently only on banjo, but I'll copy it around eventually.
    
Again, you don't miss much if you don't use this patch: it's mainly for
(a) the serial problems and (b) for hlu etc that want to test out the
32-bit interface. It does some other magical tricks as well (uses less
memory in the low 1M region by moving the screen and tty buffer to high
memory), if anybody is interested.
