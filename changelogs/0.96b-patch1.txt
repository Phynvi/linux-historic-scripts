Oh, well: it's a bug in the serial drivers that I have already fixed,
but I haven't done the c-diffs yet. I have rewritten big parts of the
serial line code to be more easily configured for different IRQ numbers,
and I noticed the bug while doing that. I'll make patch1 for 0.96b
available later today or tomorrow.
    
patch1 will be mostly just the serial driver code: it allows changing
the irq's (and port addresses) of serial devices on the fly (with an
ioctl call), so people that have ser4 on irq5 etc shouldn't have to
recompile the kernel. It also returns EBUSY if you try to open a serial
line that shares the irq-line with another line etc.
    
Another change in patch1 will the the handling of ctrl-alt-del: it will
send a SIGINT to the init process if the reset-function is disabled.
This makes it ideal for a controlled shutdown, but it does need a
/bin/init that knows about this.

PS. It seems both the DOS-fs and the extended fs will be out for
alpha-testing next week, so I assume 0.97 will have them both if things
work out ok.
