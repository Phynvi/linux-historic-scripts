This quick fix eliminates a lot of warning messages when
compiling e2fsprogs under glibc.  This is because the glibc header files
defines its own version of FD_SET, FD_ZERO, etc., and so if you need to
#include the kernel include files, you get a lot of duplicate defined
macro warning messages.  This patch simply #ifdef's out the kernel
versions of these function if the kernel is not being compiled and the
glibc header files are in use.
