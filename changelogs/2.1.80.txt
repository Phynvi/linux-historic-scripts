Linux 2.1.80

This release should fix a few networking problems, and the NFS client is
hopefully fairly stable even under the kinds of loads we have here at
Transmeta.

The 2.1.80 release also contains some initial ARM support, and contains
Ingo Molnar's better SMP interrupt handling.

NOTE NOTE NOTE! The new SMP interrupt handling is currently not very good
at autodetection. This can be a real problem, and _before_ booting the
2.1.80 kernel as compiled for SMP you should probably try to figure out a
possible IRQ override line by doing:

        echo -n pirq=; echo `scanpci -f | grep T_L | cut -c56-` | sed 's/ /,/g'
which for me gives
        pirq=0x00,0x09,0x0b

Then, after doing the above, boot into 2.1.80 and see if it finds your PCI
interrupt lines correctly. If it does, everything is fine. If it doesn't,
you need to boot with the pirq setting that you determined earlier, by
giving the kernel the pirq data at the bootup command line or by using the
LILO "append=" feature (or similar features in other bootloaders).
We'll certainly have to make the autodetection work reliably, but in the
meantime the command-line approach at least gives us a way to test the
more fundamental impacts of better interrupt handling.
