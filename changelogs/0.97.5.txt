[PATCH] Linux-0.97.5 (September 12, 1992)

SCSI CD-ROM support by David Giller (based on sd.c by Drew)

Microsoft Busmouse support by Teemu Rantanen

Do the same buffer cleanups to extfs that we just did to Minixfs.

Efficient VGA emulation in dosemu wanted to know when we write
to the pseudo-VGA memory area. Add vm86 mode hooks for that.

[Original announcement below]

Patch 5 fixes the extended filesystem problems (thanks to Remy Card), as
well as including many smaller fixes (some more fs cleanups, the CDROM
patches and several other minor changes).  Pl5 finally removes even the
last few header-files that were incompatible with the normal headers, so
the "-nostdinc -I$(KERNELHDRS)" stuff is gone.

Patch 5 should also fix the problems with iopl() that resulted in the
X8514-server having problems with 0.97.pl2 and above.

In case people are wondering, my schedule for 1.0 looks something like
this:

 - 0.98 out in about a week: this is essentially 0.97.5 + the tcp/ip
   directory, as well as any fixes that may come up.  I'll try to get
   the loadable driver interface into it too.

 - 0.99 out after 0.98 has been shaken down: a month or so.

 - 1.0 will be the same as 0.99: the only changes will be eventual
   trivial bug-fixes in case 0.99 has some problems.  This is just to
   try to get over the "X.0" bug syndrome.

There are a few on-going projects: depending on circumstances these will
be implemented sooner or later, so I won't give any promises.  These
include: loadable drivers/fs's (alpha-patches already availabla), full
support for different block-sizes (some work still required), and a
extensive rewrite of the mm routines (I'll want to make a vmm interface
similar to the vfs interface for the filesystem routines).
