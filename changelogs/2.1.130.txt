The Basted Turkey Release (aka 2.1.130)

Following hot on the heels of the greased weasel, the basted turkey rears
its handsome head. 

The basted turkey release fixes some problems that our dear weasel had,
namely:
 - NFS reference counting was wrong. It had been wrong for a long time,
   but apparently the more aggressively asynchronous code was more easily
   able to show the resultant random memory corruption. That should be
   gone.
 - The UP flu fixed officially (this has been in most of the 2.1.129
   patches)
 - kernel_thread() used to be able to cause bad things in init-routines at
   bootup. Fixed.
 - itimers could lead to bad things in SMP under heavy itimer load.
 - various mm tweaks to make it behave better under load. Things for dirty
   buffers still under consideration.
 - IP masqerading check fixes.
 - acenic gigabit ethernet driver
 - some drunken revelers fixed some MCA issues.
 - alpha PCI setup updates and video drivers
 - hfs and minix filesystem fixes.

On the whole, an excellent thing to do this evening, and goes together
remarkably well with some good red wine. Amaze your friends and relatives
by completely ignoring them, sitting in a corner with your own basted
turkey, and getting wasted on red wine. Much more fun than your average
thanksgiving dinner,
