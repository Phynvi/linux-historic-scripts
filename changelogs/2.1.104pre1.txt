pre-104

The bulk of the pre-patch is just some speeling error fixes, but there's a
one-liner that gets rid of the double interrupts with level-triggered
irq's on the IO-APIC, and that is known to have fixed one persons SCSI
tape driver (the fact that there were problems with too many interrupts
implies that something is slightly buggered in the driver, but..)

This should also have a ne2000 driver that doesn't get a NULL pointer
fault for some people, and the irq changes should hopefully make it work
on UP systems again even if the kernel is compiled as SMP.
And there are some MTRR updates.
