[PATCH] Linux-0.99.2 (January 1, 1993)

Bottom half race condition fix.

Return ENODEV for nonexistent special devices.

Fix Unix domain sockets to properly check for target equality.

Add 'wchan' to /proc/stat

[Original announcement below]

Yes, as you've probably noticed, it's now 1993 and I still haven't
released 1.0.  Sorry about that, and I have only another patchlevel to
offer.  The new kernel should mainly fix some of the keyboard problems
people have experienced, but does contain some other minor fixes.

Linux 0.99.2 is available now at nic.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus
as both sources and diffs against 0.99.1 the diffs are essentially the
same as the second alpha-diffs I released for limited testing, with only
minor fixes to fs/exec.c and fs/open.c.

Please try out 0.99.2: the more feedback (hopefully positive) I get on
it, the faster 1.0 will be out.

Changes from pl1 are mainly:
 - pretty much rewritten low-level keyboard handling IO - this time
   actually trying to do it by the book.  It now handles resend requests
   from the keyboard etc.
 - you can run executables from filesystems without bmap support.  This
   mainly means NFS and msdos.  Note that while it's possible, it's
   slower and less memory-efficient than using a "normal" linux
   filesystem, and should generally be avoided.
 - /proc filesystem changes: /proc/kmsg can be used to log the kernel
   messages under X11 (instead of using the older system call to do the
   same), and there are changes to the statistics routines (WCHAN).

+ various minor fixes (non-existent devices are handled better, some
changes to socket bind behaviour etc).
