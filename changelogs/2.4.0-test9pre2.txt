Linux 2.4.0-test9pre2

    - scsi fixes
    - network updates
    - PCI bridge scanning fix: assign numbers properly
    - sparc updates
    - Riel VM update
    - disallow re-mounting same filesystem in same place multiple times.
      Too confusing. And /etc/mtab gets strange.
    - PPC updates (including PPC-related drivers etc)
    - more initcall updates
    - various net drvr updates and fixes
    - "extern inline" -> "static inline".  It doesn't matter right now,
      but it's proactive for future gcc versions.
