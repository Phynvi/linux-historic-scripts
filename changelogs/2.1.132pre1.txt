Linux 2.1.132pre1

There's a new pre-patch out there. I'm back from Finland, and have caught
up with just about half the email that I got during the stay. However,
even the part I caught up with I may have partly missed something in,
because (for obvious reasons) I didn't read them as carefully (*) as I
usually do.

This should fix at least part of the NFS problems people have reported: 
there was code to completely incorrectly invalidate quite valid write
requests under some circumstances. The pre-patch also contains the first
batch of patches merged in from Alan, and the "rmdir" problems should be
fixed (mostly thanks to Al Viro).

This pre-patch also gets rid of some imho completely unnecessary
complexity in some of the VM memory freeing routines. There have been
patches floating around that added more heuristics on when to do
something, and this tries to get the same result by just removing old
heuristics that didn't make much sense.

(*) Even my usual "careful" is not very careful by other peoples
standards. So when _I_ say that I wasn't very careful, you should just
assume that I was reading my email about as carefully as a hyper-active
hedgehog on some serious uppers. Can you say "ignored email" three times
quickly while chewing on an apple?
