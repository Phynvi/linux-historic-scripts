Linux-2.1.126

 - architecture updates for alpha and MIPS (and some minor PPC updates
   too)
 - joystick updates
 - MCA stuff from Alan. The guy has too much free time on his hands.
 - stallion driver cosmetic update
 - nasty SMP race with "task queues" (not the scheduling kind), where we
   were mixing atomic metaphores, resulting in a mess. Usually a benign
   one, but occasionally you could force oopses.
 - some floppy and ide updates
 - PS/2 mouse driver integrated into the PC keyboard controller. That got
   rid of a lot of really nasty problems (it's the same controller,
   accessing it from two different drivers was always messy)
 - various driver updates: floppy, ide, network drivers, sound, video..
 - various small FS fixes - finally _really_ getting the ENOENT vs ENOTDIR
   stuff right, nfsd updates, remounting fixes, filesize limits on NFS 
   and smbfs, ntfs and ufs updates...
 - shm updates from Alan
 - cleanup of some MM stuff, I hope Andrea will re-do the patches and I'll
   look at the other parts.
 - unix fd garbage collection fix, getting rid of circular dependencies..

And probably various other small fixes that I have thankfully forgotten
about.
