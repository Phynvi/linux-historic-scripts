Linux 2.0.36pre7

This doesn't fix the icmp or threaded socket handling stuff that does eventually
need curing. It does however fix all sorts of other fun things. With this
release the Cyclades should be happy and the Cyrix detect/AMD detect shoul
work properly, including the old AMD bug detect.

Consider this your last chance to scream about 2.0.36 bugs
