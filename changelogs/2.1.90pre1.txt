I just put a pre-90 on ftp.kernel.org, and I'm happy to report that Davem
seems to have found and fixed the TCP performance problem, which means
that the code-freeze for 2.2 is going to go into effect shortly..

pre-90 does a few other minor things, like for example getting rid of
kerneld because the new kmod thing is a lot simpler in many ways. Let's
see what the reaction to that is, but I'm fairly certain that this was a
major good thing: I've personally never liked kerneld, but kmod seems to
be a much nicer and more controlled way of handling the same issues that
kerneld tried to do. I'd actually almost be willing to use the thing
myself, something that was never true of kerneld.

This also moves the WD7000 SCSI driver to a working status again, thanks
to Miroslav Zagorac.

But the interesting and important part of the patches are the networking
fixes from David and Bill Hawes..
