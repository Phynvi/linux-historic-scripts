Linux 2.4.0-test7pre1

    - fix PCI resource bug that crept in in test6 due to the new
      requirements to handle multiple bus regions transparently
    - ll_rw_block documentation
    - sound driver module counting bugfix and cleanup (move to named
      initializers)
    - directory rename bug fix for busy directories (oops)
    - allow "init_new_context()" to fail - it can do so on some
      architectures when out of memory.
    - networking updates - TCP retransmission and ordering logic
    - fix strsep(). Not that anybody cared.
