- pre2:
    - Stephen Rothwell: directory notify could return with the lock held
    - Richard Henderson: CLOCKS_PER_SEC on alpha.
    - Jeff Garzik: ramfs and highmem: kmap() the page to clear it
    - Asit Mallick: enable the APIC in the official order
    - Neil Brown: avoid rd deadlock on io_request_lock by using a
      private rd-request function. This also avoids unnecessary
      request merging at this level.
    - Ben LaHaise: vmalloc threadign and overflow fix
    - Randy Dunlap: USB updates (plusb driver). PCI cacheline size.
    - Neil Brown: fix a raid1 on top of lvm bug that crept in in pre1
    - Alan Cox: various (Athlon mmx copy, NULL ptr checks for
      scsi_register etc).
    - Al Viro: fix /proc permission check security hole.
    - Can-Ru Yeou: SiS301 fbcon driver
    - Andrew Morton: NMI oopser and kernel page fault punch through
      both console_lock and timerlist_lock to make sure it prints out..
    - Jeff Garzik: clean up "kmap()" return type (it returns a kernel
      virtual address, ie a "void *").
    - Jeff Garzik: network driver docs, various one-liners.
    - David Miller: add generic "special" flag to page flags, to be
      used by architectures as they see fit. Like keeping track of
      cache coherency issues.
    - David Miller: sparc64 updates, make sparc32 boot again
    - Davdi Millner: spel "synchronous" correctly
    - David Miller: networking - fix some bridge issues, and correct
      IPv6 sysctl entries.
    - Dan Aloni: make fork.c use proper macro rather than doing
      get_exec_domain() by hand.
