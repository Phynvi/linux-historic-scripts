Ok. I didn't make 2.4.0 in 2000. Tough. I tried, but we had some
last-minute stuff that needed fixing (ie the dirty page lists etc), and the
best I can do is make a prerelease.
                    
There's a 2.4.0-prerelease out there, and this is basically it. I want
people to test it for a while, and I want to give other architectures the
chance to catch up with some of the changes, but read my lips: no more
recounts. There is no "prerelease1", to become "prerelease2" and so on.
                    
One thing other architectures will want to catch up with is the changes to
handle 2GHz+ machines, which due to overflow issues caused "loops_per_sec"
to become "loops_per_jiffy". And some architectures have not had much
chance to synchronize with me due to other fires to put out.
                    
Give it your worst. After you recover from being hung-over, of course.
