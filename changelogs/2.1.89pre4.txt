Linux 2.1.89-4

It should fix the problem another way that I'm happier with (fixing that
problem also revealed a few other misuses of close_fp() due to historical
reasons - the uses really needed to be "fput()"s instead).
2.1.89-4 also uses "struct file" for mmap's, which means that the problem
that somebody was complaining about with mmap (that the mapping would
exist even after the last "release()" on that file, and thus the file
would still be active) are gone. As of -4 the kernel will guarantee that
it will call the file->f_op->release() onle after there really aren't any
uses of that file pointer any more..
