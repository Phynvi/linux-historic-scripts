The main notables are the network fixes (uninitialized skb->dev could and
did cause oopses in ip_defrag) and the mm fixes (dirty pages without
mappings etc, causing problems in page_launder).

The mm cleanups also include removing "swapout()" as a VM operation, as
nobody can sanely do anything more than just marking the page dirty anyway
(the real work is done by writepage() these days), and doing that
explicitly simplifies VM scanning considerably.

This still doesn't tell "sync()" about dirty pages (ie the "innd loses the
active file after a reboot" bug), but now the places that mark pages dirty
are under control. Next step..

- NIIBE Yutaka: SuperH update
- Geert Uytterhoeven: m68k update
- David Miller: TCP RTO calc fix, UDP multicast fix etc
- Duncan Laurie: ServerWorks PIRQ routing definition.
- mm PageDirty cleanups, added sanity checks, and don't lose the bit.
