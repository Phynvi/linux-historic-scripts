Linux 2.1.107pre2

Are there people out there that use the loopback device with SMP, and have
been irritated at it not working lately?
I gave up on waiting for any real loop device maintainer to step up and
fix this, so I made a very small patch that I suspect may fix the problem.
I'm not going to test it myself, and I'm fairly disgusted with how badly
the loop device is being maintained at all. But if people feel they want
to test it out, go to

        ftp.kernel.org//pub/linux/kernel/testing

and fetch the current pre-107-2 patch.
It also has some other patches to the loop device that I picked up and
that looked like the right thing to do (use dentry pointers instead of
inodes to make mount/umount happy.
