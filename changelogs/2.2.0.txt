Ok, this seems to be due to pre9 removing some rather bogus code that
happened to hide another problem in open_namei().
I haven't actually tested this, but it looks really obvious, so does this
patch fix it for you? (This should also fix a potential performance
bogosity - there's absolutely no reason why we should get the directory
lock when we don't need to for a normal open of an existing file).
