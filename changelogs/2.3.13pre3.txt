Linux 2.3.13pre3

Ok, I finally did what I've wanted to do for a _loong_ time: get rid of
the horrible #ifdef CONFIG_XXXX mess in init/main.c.

Instead, any driver, filesystem or other entity can just register a kernel
command line string and/or a initialization function that will be executed
by using a magic section in the kernel linkage. So there is no need to
touch a common file to add a new driver or a architecture-specific kernel
command line entry.

I've fixed up a few of the old command lines and initialization functions,
but I'm hoping that driver writers can re-instate their own setup
functions rather than me trying to fix up them all by hand. For that
reason there is now a pre-patch-2.3.13-3 on ftp.kernel.org under
"testing".

Go wild.
