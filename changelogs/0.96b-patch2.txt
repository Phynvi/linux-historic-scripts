As promised, here is the second patch for 0.96b which hopefully clears
up the problems with some mice by implementing most of the serial line
flags like 5-8 bit characters and parity. It mainly corrects only
serial problems, but there are a couple of other patches in it too: the
fsqrt emulation patch is here, so if you already did it, you'll get a
bad patch for that file (which you can ignore). This patch also changes
all instances of signal-setting to use the "send_sig()" subroutine which
should allow gdb to debug all signals.

Apart from the serial lines, I also cleaned up the general tty-handling
routines slightly and removed at least one race-condition in the tty
code. I don't know if it's noticeable, though.

You'll need patch1 (available from all the normal sites) in order to
apply this one. As usual, I'd like to hear if this patch does help
people, or if there are new problems. This patch will also be available
on the normal ftp sites, but as it was pretty minor, I decided I might
as well include it in the post (uuencoded and compressed).

(I also corrected the all-time favourite bug: linux now reports the
right version number once more..)
