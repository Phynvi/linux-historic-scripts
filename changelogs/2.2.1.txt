Linux 2.2.1 - the Brown Paper Bag release

The subject says it all. We did have a few paper-bag-inducing bugs in
2.2.0, so there's a 2.2.1 out there now, just a few days after 2.2.0.
Oh, well. These things happen,

                Linus

- the stupid off-by-one bug 'execute a coredump' crash found by Ingo
- __down_interruptible on alpha
- move "esstype" to outside a #ifdef MODULE
- NFSD rename/rmdir fixes
- revert to old array.c
- change comment about __PAGE_OFFSET
- missing "vma = NULL" case for avl find_vma()
