Linux 2.0.40-rc7

Well, lets pretend, like many times before, that this really is the
last release candidate for the 2.0.40-kernel.  I won't bother with
excusing myself for being late (bordering on the extreme) with this
release.  Better late than never.

    does not support MCA
o   Change my e-mail address to                (David Weinehall)
    tao@kernel.org; since I have such
    an address, I might as well use it
    for kernel-related matters.  Also
    added my GPG-key information
o   Add default:-clause to a switch in vsprintf (David Weinehall)
    | Minor whitespace-changes while at it
