pre-2.1.132-2..

..is out there, and has everybodys favourite fix, ie the version number
has been bumped this time. In addition, compared to pre-1, it has:
 - autofs fix (uninitialized inode number could lead to "interesting"
   problems)
 - some more NFS fixes (file truncation with pending write-backs this time)
 - disable_irq()/enable_irq() now nests properly, as Alan convinced me
   (quite rightly) that they have to nest in order to work sanely with
   shared interrupt and multiple CPU's and various other schenarios.
 - more merges from Alan, we're getting closer to being synched up.
Most of the bulk of the thing is the irda stuff, that most people can
ignore.
