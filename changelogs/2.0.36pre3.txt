Linux 2.0.36pre3

[ftp.uk.linux.org:/pub/linux/alan/...]
Ok this took a bit longer than I intended. Im releasing 2.0.36pre3 now for
two reasons

        1.      Its got the 5.0.20 AIC7xxx driver in it - this should help
                the adaptec afflicted
        2.      It has modular sound in it

Now for the modular sound Im unsure if its a good idea or bad to switch
to it for a 2.0.x kernel. Its always going to be available as an add on
and I suspect be something most vendors will ship (bearing in mind the target
markets are often not keen to recompile kernels). So I'd appreciate feedback
on both if modular sound behaves for you (it should 8)) and also opinions
on whether it should become a standard item.

Apart from that all I have queued to do now are a few small bug fixes and
to wait for the final version of the isdn updates. Those are pretty important
as they should include code thats been certified with telco approval in some
of the weird parts of the world (most of the EEC to start with) where code
certification for the ISDN 'D' channel protocol is required for each card.

If you have a new feature you desperately want for 2.0.36, then probably
too late. If there are bug fixes floating around notin 2.0.36pre3 you think
matter please send me them - I'd rather get duplicates than miss stuff.
Finally - treat pre3 with a bit of care - its not as tested as the pre patches
tend to be.
