Ok, does it still work with 2.1.103?
2.1.103 has this patch, and also changes certain other things wrt interrupts in
a way that both Edgar and Ingo seem to agree on, and it's been stable on
certain boxes where plain 2.1.102 wasn't.

2.1.103 also disables the early Cyrix cpuid stuff, because we now seem to
have confirmation that this is what corrupts DMA IDE transfers (the cyrix
code steps on magic motherboard IO ports - which Intel probably put there
specially to mess with Cyrix. But maybe I'm just cynical). So people that
have had problems with disk corruption and are brave enough to try, this
could be an interesting experiment.
[ Thanks to Gerard Roudier and Alan Cox for chasing down the IDE
  corruption issue, btw ]
