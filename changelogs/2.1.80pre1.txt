Pre-2.1.80..

 I just put a pre-2.1.80 on ftp.kernel.org that should fix the fat-related
problems. The reason I put it there is because I got several patches that
fixed the FAT problems _and_ something else, and they all obviously
clashed with each other so neither part got applied.

 So I'd ask people who sent me patches to maybe re-send the parts of the
patches that are still relevant,
