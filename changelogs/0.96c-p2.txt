[PATCH] Linux-0.96c-p2

This one cleans up "select()" handling a lot, using the VFS virtual
functions rather than hardcoding certain types of special files. 
  
More importantly, the select cleanups are the impetus for the "wait
queue" handling with "add_wait_queue()" and "remove_wait_queue()" and
raceless sleeping.  That's still how it's done today, although the
low-level implementation details have been changed several times.

Other:

 - Add msdos filesystem by Werner Almesberger (small 12-bit only for now).
 - Implement ETXTBUSY
 - Add "volatile" to a lot of the inline asm
 - Logitec Busmouse driver by James Banks, David Giller and Nathan Laredo
 - SG keyboard map (Swiss German?)
