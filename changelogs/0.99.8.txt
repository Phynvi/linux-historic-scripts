[PATCH] Linux-0.99.8 (April 8, 1993)

Mount root filesystem read-only (conditional for now).

SCSI updates.

Stephen Tweedie shows up in ext2, with an enhanced block allocator. 

Signal handling update with generated code on the stack and a
"sigreturn" system call.  This was needed to maintain compatibility in
the face of a changed stack layout.  sigsuspend() also works correctly now. 

[original announcement below]

Yet another kernel release is now available on nic.funet.fi in the usual
place (pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus for those of you that have already
forgotten), and will probably show up on the other ftp-sites within a
day or two.  There are two new files:
    
 linux-0.99.8.tar.z - the full gzipped and tarred source-tree of the
   linux kernel.
    
 linux-0.99.patch8.z - unified diffs against the last official release
   (0.99pl7).

There is no SLIP or new networking routines in this kernel despite the
rumors that have been flying around - the main changes to 0.99.7 are
(some of them were in 0.99pl7A as well):

- the signal handling code has been extensively reworked, and should be
  POSIX as well as clean.
- dosfs is upgraded to version 12 (Werner Almesberger)
- xiafs is upgraded to the latest version (Qi Xia)
- ext2fs is upgraded to the latest version (Remy Card/Stephen Tweedie)
- FPU-emulation patches for v86 mode and precision rounding (Bill
  Metzenthen)
- SCSI patches by various people (Eric Youngdale & co)
- XT harddisk support (Pat Mackinlay)
- new trial code to try to handle 387 lockups on some systems more
  gracefully.
- keyboard, lp and serial driver fixes
- various minor changes (mounting root read-only, bootup messages
  cleaned up etc)
    
As always, comments/bugs etc are encouraged,
    
            Linus
