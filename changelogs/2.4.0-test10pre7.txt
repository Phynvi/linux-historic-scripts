2.4.0-test10-pre7

Ok, this one contains at least a preliminary fix for the problem with
truncate together with a concurrent page access - the bug that causes
oopses in block_read_full_page() and filemap_nopage().

This is a fairly minimal fix, and I'll still have to verify that I caught
all the relevant places, but I wanted people who have seen this problem to
please test this out asap - I'll make a real test10 later once I've
integrated some further patches from Alan and Jeff, but this should fix
the major show-stopper bug.

        Thanks,

                        Linus
