Linux-2.4.0-test6 

- speling fixces.
 - fix drm/agp initialization issue
 - saner modules installation     
        (*) NOTE! This may/will break some module setups.  Files go in
        different places. Better places.
 - per-CPU irq count area. Better for caches, simpler code.              
 - "mem_map + MAP_NR(x)" => virt_to_page(x)             
        (*) Purely syntactic change at this point. NUMA memory handling
        will take advantage of this during 2.5.x
 - page_address() returns (void *) to make it clearer that it is a 
   virtual address (it's the reverse of "virt_to_page()", see above).
 - zimage builds should work again.
 - Make current gcc's able to compile the kernel.
 - fix irq probing in IDE driver: this caused strange irq problems for
   other drivers later on (notably PCMCIA, which is one of the few 
   drivers to still probe for ISA interrupts on modern machines).
 - Intel microcode update update.
 - mips/mips64/sh/sparc/sparc64/acorn updates
 - DAC960 driver update
 - floppy shouldn't scream on open/close
 - console driver does correct palette setting.  No more black screens
   with XF86-4.x
 - ISDN updates
 - PCI layer can assign resources from multiple IO and memory windows
 - yenta_socket driver no longer oopsable on unload.
 - flush_dcache_page() for more virtual dcache coherency issues
 - ext2_get_block() races fixed   
 - jffs bugfixes galore.  
 - user resource tracking infrastructure re-organization.
 - umsdos works again.
 - loopback shouldn't deadlock
