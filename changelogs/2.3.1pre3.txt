Linux 2.3.1pre3

As to 2.3.x, we're beginning with a long overdue waitqueue cleanup, which
means that a lot of small details need to get fixed in a variety of files.
A working pre-patch of this is to be found as pre-patch-2.3.1-3, but not
all drivers have been fixed - and help is appreciated (even drivers that
_have_ been fixed have not necessarily actually been tested due to lack of
hardware).
