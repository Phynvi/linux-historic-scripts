pre-2.1.99-3

There's a new pre-patch on ftp.kernel.org, that does:

 - the networking fixes that didn't get into 98 due to various mess-ups
 - mtrr patches are there by default
 - all the irq fixes we know of to date are there (and hopefully even the
   ne2000 things should work with the SELF-IPI change)
 - various documentation updates and bugfixes (the best way to know that a
   stable kernel is approaching is to notice that somebody starts to
   spellcheck the kernel - it has so far never failed)

in short, all known bugs should be fixed, but hey, what else is new?
