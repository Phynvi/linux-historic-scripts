[PATCH] Linux-0.99.7A (March 21, 1993)

More net-1 work. It's endless.

XT harddisk support by Pat Mackinlay.

sys_fsync() and SysV IPC code sys_ipc() stubs appear.

[original announcement below]

I don't generally announce ALPHA-diffs to quite this large an audience,
but I'll be partying^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hunavailable for the rest of the
week, and it's unlikely that I will be able to check mails or the
newsgroups until the start of April.  As a result, I'm putting up my
latest kernel version for ftp as it fixes some things in 0.99.7.
    
The ALPHA-diffs can be found on nic.funet.fi: in the directory
pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus.  If you dislike patching, you can get the
full sources in "linux-0.99.7A.tar.z", or just get the diff file
"ALPHA-diff.z".
    
Changes in this release:
- the new kernel now detects the lock-up condition at startup if you
  have a faulty 386/387 coupling, and will use software floating point
  in that case.
- the Xia filesystem is updated to the latest version
- the DOS filesystem is updated to the latest version
- the XT disk driver is included: I haven't been able to test it, but
  at least it won't bother anybody if you don't configure it in..
- the latest serial diffs are in
- minor ultrastor fixes
- some changes to the keyboard and line printer drivers: I hope the
  keyboard lockups that some people have reported would be gone with
  this release.
- some fixes to arp.c
    
I'll be interested in success/failure reports, although I won't be able
to answer them for some time (and I might miss some of the posts on
c.o.l).
