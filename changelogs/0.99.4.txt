Get pl4, and it should be gone.  There was a bug in the handling of
uninitialized interrupts in pl3, where they could result in either the
wrong interrupt mask being loaded leading to interrupt lock-out or (in
some cases) bit corruption at the user level.  The symptoms are exactly
as you describe: a good interrupt that didn't happen to be locked out
will correct the interrupt mask, and the system goes on (it can be
moving the mouse, but it might also be a keyboard event etc).
