Linux 2.1.127

Ok,
 after two fairly hectic weeks for me, 2.1.127 is finally out there.

This kernel does:
 - various small but important networking fixes from Davem (thanks). One
   of them is the "anti-nagle" bit to allow programs that know what they
   are doing to avoid nagling by telling the kernel so. This is mainly
   things like Web servers and ftp-servers that can use this option
   together with "sendfile()".
 - scheduling timeout interface change: the new interface is much more
   logical than the old one, and allows us to get the jiffies wrap-around
   case right. Thanks to Andrea Arcangeli.
 - Various driver updates: specialix, sonycd,
 - Memory management fixups. Handle out-of-memory conditions correctly,
   and handle high memory load much more gracefully.
 - sparc and PowerPC architecture updates
 - 3c509 SMP fix, tlan PCI probe update.
 - scsi driver updates: ncr53c8xx, aic7xxx, dc390
 - filesystem updates: autofs, hfs, umsdos

Go, test, be happy,

                Linus
