Linux 2.2.2pre4

In a superhuman effort to not get killed by my wife, I delayed the latest
release for a day. And in fact, it's still just a pre-release, because I
wanted to check with Ingo that I have his latest IO-APIC code with the
proper handling of ExtINT. Ingo?

Anyway, the "not quite valentine days release" (also known as the "horny
greased weasel", aka "presidents day" release ;), is right now a pre-patch
on ftp.kernel.org: /pub/linux/kernel/testing/pre-patch-2.2.2-4.gz.

Happily, I haven't heard of any new real show-stoppers, which is good
(especially considering the fact that I gave it an extra week just to hear
if somebody could come up with some new problems). The things fixed
relative to 2.2.1 are:

 - the inode thing. If you don't know, don't worry.
 - config scripts updated
 - IO-APIC cleanups and fixes, so that people with strange motherboards
   should be able to reboot cleanly and not get unexpected interrupts.
 - 2kB sector media (ie mostly MO) fixes. See all the warnings on the
   lists about fdisk confusion etc if you have one of these things.
 - IDE disk cleanups/fixes (geometry and autodetection)
 - PS/2 mouse hides ACK's again
 - pty crash fix
 - some network driver fixes (out-of-memory and shared interrupts)
 - some sound and video updates.
 - lockd cookie fixes
 - nfsd readdir reply cache fix
 - filesystem/VM deadlock avoidance (new deamon: kpiod)
 - SMP scheduler race condition (which nobody has probably ever seen)
 - TCP socket locking fix

Most of the above are really hard to see in the first place, and not
something most people would ever hit (with the possible exception of the
inode thang).  But it would be good to have a really rock solid 2.2.2, so
if people could just bother to check that it works for them, and I'll make
this official tomorrow.
