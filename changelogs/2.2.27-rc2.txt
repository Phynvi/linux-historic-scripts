o       CAN-2005-0001: fixed expand_stack() SMP race            (Redhat)

          overflow. There are two bugs in the handling of SMB
          responses that result in remote kernel overflows. Due
          to the nature of the bugs both seem to be very hard
          to exploit (in the sense of remote code execution or
          local privilege escalation) but are trivial remote
          kernel crashes.
o       rose_rt_ioctl: lack of bounds checking                  (Coverity)
o       sdla_xfer: lack of bounds checking                      (Coverity)
o       coda: bounds checking for tainted scalars               (Coverity)
o       sendmsg compat wrapper fixes for 64bit compat mode      (Olaf Kirch)
