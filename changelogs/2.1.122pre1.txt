2.1.122pre1

This may or may not fix the APM problems, and the INITRD ones.  The
INITRD one in particular was a case of a fairly inexplicable test that
shouldn't have been there in the first place breaking when something
completely unrelated was cleaned up..

The APM breakage was simply due to it being in the wrong place.  The
patch looks bigger than it really is - it really only moves the file to
the proper directory, and makes sure that it should compile with the
standard assembler..
