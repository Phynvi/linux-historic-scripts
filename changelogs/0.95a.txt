[PATCH] Linux-0.95a (March 17, 1992)

Oops.  I had forgotten to change the kernel version number in 0.95 (so
it showed as 0.12). 

 - 80x50 console on standard VGA
 - do "memcpy_fromfs()" and "memcpy_tofs()" rather than byte-at-a-time
   to improve performance (inspired by some earlier patches by Keith White)
 - allow select() on many more file descriptors
 - support up to 4 serial ports (and increase buffering size)
 - Branko Lankester helped make extended partitions work and implemented
   DM partition table support

The big deal in the release notes is actually that the root diskette
maintainership had been moved over to Jim Winstead Jr.
