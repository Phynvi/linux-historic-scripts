[PATCH] Linux-0.96a (May 22, 1992 ??)
  
More VFS cleanups.  Minixfs code reorganized to be more logical, and
split up into a few new files. 

SCSI support!!

 - Drew Eckhardt does the SCSI stuff, and does the ST01/ST02 lowlevel
   driver. 

 - Ultrastor driver by David Gentzel. 

 - Tommy Thorn shows up again.  He did the Danish keyboard tables, now
   he does the AHA 1542 driver.  Ten years later we ended up being
   co-workers at Transmeta ;)

First networking code appears: X11 port needs UNIX domain sockets, and
thus the "socketcall()" system call.  It's not really meant for real
networking, although the code will eventually evolve to support that. 
Which explains some of the bad early decisions..  ;)

Werner Almerberger starts taking over floppy driver maintenance.  Thank
Gods!

Johan Myreen translates my assembly-level keyboard driver into C code,
and adds support for diacriticals. 

OMAGIC a.out format support

Syslog support for the kernel appears.  If I remember correctly, this
was Peter MacDonald, but no mention of that in the sources.
