        ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/alan/2.0.36pre/
Changes this release
o       Cyclades bug fix (Cyclades Corp)
o       440GX device ids (Leonard Zubkoff)
o       BusLogic update (Leonard Zubkoff)
o       New version of the ROSE protocol layers (F6FBB)
o       TCP works with SO_BINDTODEVICE  (Phil Gladstone)
o       TCP select error
o       Hooks for multithreaded ELF core dumps (Alan Cox)
        (Phil Gladstone maintains the ELF mt core dump stuff and gdb patch)

I was going to integrate this patch but I got some slightly odd results
that looked like a double kfree and the patch didnt seem quite perfect yet.
Anyway - you shouldnt need to hack anything to use it now
Stuff I know I have left to worry about:

o       Andre - can you check there is nothing in your jumbo patches I
        should have (I dont want to put the UDMA/new timer stuff into a
        2.0.x kernel). I couldnt see any easy way to seperate the MHz
        computation from it
o       Try and get the mt core dumps working
o       Two crash reports from AF_UNIX sockets that look like a long
        standing race.
